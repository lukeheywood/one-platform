# Governance Index

This section exposes the **governance surfaces** that constrain and stabilise ONE.

Governance in ONE exists to:
- prevent capability drift,
- block unsupported claims,
- enforce promotion discipline,
- and ensure authority remains explicit.

The Atlas **does not redefine governance**.
It links to canonical governance artifacts maintained in their respective repositories.

---

## Governance scope

Governance within ONE covers:

- capability promotion and demotion
- contract definition and enforcement
- termination and abstention rules
- freeze and invariance boundaries
- evidence requirements for claims

Governance applies equally to:
- workflows,
- diagnostics,
- documentation,
- and promoted artifacts.

No component is exempt.

## Canonical governance artifacts

The following artifacts are treated as **sources of truth** for governance and are referenced, not duplicated, by the Atlas:

- **Governance Overview**
  - High-level governance philosophy and scope  
  - Defines why governance exists and what it constrains  
  *(Linked from the main repository governance documentation)*

- **Contract Stack**
  - Formal system contracts
  - Input/output definitions
  - Validation and termination rules
  - Promotion gates and regression checks

- **Promotion Rules**
  - Criteria for promoting capabilities into the Atlas
  - Evidence requirements
  - Review and revision discipline

- **Freeze Declarations**
  - Explicitly frozen orientations, invariants, and semantics
  - Conditions under which freezes may be revised

Each artifact is authoritative within its defined scope.

---

## Governance behaviour

Governance in ONE is **constraining, not advisory**.

- Unsupported behaviour is blocked rather than tolerated
- Ambiguous outputs must abstain rather than infer
- Capabilities without evidence are not promoted
- Violations trigger review, not justification

Governance does not optimise outcomes.
It preserves integrity.

---

## Relationship to authority

Governance operates under the **System Authority** defined in the Atlas.

- Governance artifacts define constraints
- Authority defines ownership and accountability
- Neither is delegated to models or tools

Where governance rules conflict with convenience, governance prevails.

---

## Revision discipline

Governance artifacts may evolve, but only through:
- explicit revision,
- documented rationale,
- and promotion through the Atlas.

Implicit change is prohibited.
