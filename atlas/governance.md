# Governance

Governance in ONE is about preventing drift.

This includes:
- Explicit boundaries on what may be public
- Promotion rules for artifacts
- Naming and structural discipline
- A bias toward conservative claims

Governance exists to support long-term trust, not speed.

## Identity–System Boundary

ONE enforces a strict separation between author identity and system state.

Artifacts in this Atlas may be incomplete, evolving, replaced, or deprecated over time.  
This does not represent author capability, readiness, or identity.

This boundary enables:
- public inspection without defensive framing
- governed promotion of artifacts as performance checkpoints
- safe exposure of systems-in-progress

This separation is enforced as a system-wide invariant.

→ Governance invariant: IDENTITY_SYSTEM_SEPARATION_INVARIANT_V1
