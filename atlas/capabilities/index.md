# Capabilities Index

This page describes the capabilities that are **currently present and stabilised** within ONE.

Capabilities listed here are:
- implemented or demonstrably operational,
- governed by explicit contracts or constraints,
- and eligible to be referenced elsewhere in the Atlas.

Anything not listed here should be treated as experimental, incomplete, or out of scope.

---

## Capability states

Capabilities within ONE fall into one of three states:

- **Promoted** — stable, inspectable, and referenced elsewhere in the Atlas.
- **Experimental** — under exploration or refinement, not yet promoted.
- **Out of scope** — intentionally excluded from the system.

Only **Promoted** capabilities are relied upon by case studies or architectural descriptions.

---

## Promoted capabilities

The following capabilities are currently stabilised and promoted:

- **System Atlas**
  - Canonical truth surface describing what exists, how it is governed, and who owns authority.
  - Provides inspectable documentation for structure, constraints, and promoted artifacts.

- **Governance & Contract Framework**
  - Explicit contracts defining input/output expectations, validation, termination, and abstention.
  - Promotion rules and invariants used to prevent drift and over-claiming.

- **Explainability Under Load**
  - Structured workflows that expose decision paths, assumptions, and failure modes under real constraints.
  - Demonstrated through promoted case studies.

- **Workflow Skeletons**
  - Reference workflow structures separating exploration from execution.
  - Designed to integrate with broader platform and infrastructure environments.

A more detailed view of individual capabilities is maintained in the [Capability Registry](registry.md).

---

## Experimental capabilities

The following areas are under active exploration but are **not yet promoted**:

- Agent orchestration patterns beyond constrained execution
- Advanced diagnostics and coherence evaluation tooling
- Automated contract discovery and enforcement
- Multi-system or cross-domain workflow composition

These areas may appear in drafts, discussions, or exploratory artifacts but should not be treated as stable.

---

## Explicitly out of scope

The following are intentionally excluded from ONE:

- Autonomous agents with self-directed authority
- Systems that mask missing structure through probabilistic confidence
- Unbounded optimisation or goal-seeking behaviour
- Opaque model behaviour without inspectable constraints
- Claims of general intelligence or self-understanding

These exclusions are design decisions, not temporary limitations.

---

## Promotion discipline

A capability is promoted into this index only when:
- its behaviour can be explained deterministically,
- ownership and responsibility boundaries are explicit,
- failure modes are documented,
- and evidence exists to support its inclusion.

Promotion decisions are recorded and governed.
