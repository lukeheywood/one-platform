# Case Studies Index

This section contains **promoted case studies** demonstrating how ONE behaves under real-world constraints.

Case studies exist to provide **evidence**, not narrative.
They document system behaviour, limits, and failure modes in conditions where ambiguity, load, or partial information are present.

Only case studies listed here are considered canonical.

## Purpose of case studies

Case studies in ONE serve three functions:

- **Demonstration**  
  Show how promoted capabilities operate in practice.

- **Verification**  
  Provide inspectable evidence supporting claims made elsewhere in the Atlas.

- **Constraint exposure**  
  Surface limits, failure modes, and abstention behaviour under load.

Case studies are not success stories.
They are inspection artifacts.

## Promotion criteria

A case study is promoted only when:

- the system behaviour is reproducible,
- contracts and constraints are explicit,
- decision paths are inspectable,
- failure modes are documented,
- and supporting artifacts are available.

Case studies without evidence are not promoted.

## Promoted case studies

The following case studies are currently promoted:

- **Explainability Under Load**  
  Demonstrates deterministic explanation surfaces, constraint enforcement, and failure handling under real-world ambiguity.  
  → [View case study](explainability-under-load.md)

Additional case studies may be added only through explicit promotion.

## Non-promoted material

The following are intentionally excluded from this index:

- drafts or exploratory write-ups
- internal notes or logs
- hypothetical scenarios
- marketing-style narratives
- demonstrations without inspectable artifacts

Such materials may exist elsewhere but are not treated as evidence.

---

## Relationship to governance

Case study promotion is governed.

- Evidence informs promotion
- Governance approves inclusion
- Authority remains external

No case study may self-authorise its inclusion in this index.

Status: Canonical evidence surface.
