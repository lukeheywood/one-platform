# Case Studies

Case studies document **stabilised work** that has been **promoted** into the System Atlas.

They exist to provide **inspectable evidence**, not narrative.
Each case study exposes:
- observed context and constraints,
- design decisions (including why naïve approaches failed),
- explicit trade-offs and limits,
- and what the system does *not* attempt to do.

They are written for senior engineers, architects, and technical hiring managers.
