# North Star Orientation

ONE is governed by a fixed semantic orientation.

Before AI capability is applied, a system must be able to:
- represent its structure explicitly,
- identify ownership and responsibility boundaries,
- explain its behaviour deterministically,
- and surface uncertainty rather than obscure it.

AI is used to assist reasoning, exploration, and execution **only after** these conditions are met.
No component is permitted to compensate for missing structure, unclear ownership, or undefined constraints.

This orientation prioritises:
- legibility over cleverness,
- explicit contracts over implicit behaviour,
- stability under load over apparent intelligence,
- and inspectability over optimisation.

Where these conditions cannot be satisfied, the system must abstain rather than guess.

This orientation is fixed.
All design decisions, capabilities, and promotions within ONE are evaluated against it.
