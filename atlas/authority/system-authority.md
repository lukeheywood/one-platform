# System Authority

ONE is an authored system.

This System Atlas describes the system **as intentionally designed, governed, and maintained**.
All classifications, constraints, representations, and promoted artifacts documented here are deliberate and owned.

ONE does not claim autonomous authority.

Models, workflows, and tools operate strictly within boundaries established by explicit design decisions.
No component is permitted to self-authorise behaviour, interpretation, scope, or truth.

System authority resides outside execution.

- Models generate outputs, not decisions
- Workflows enforce structure, not intent
- Artifacts represent state, not belief

Epistemic authority for the system rests with the author.
Accountability for system behaviour, limitations, trade-offs, and failure modes is explicitly retained at that boundary.

Where uncertainty exists, it is stated.
Where behaviour is constrained, it is documented.
Where claims are made, they are supported by inspectable structure or evidence.

Authority in ONE is **declared, bounded, and reviewable**.
It does not emerge, adapt, or transfer implicitly.

This authority model remains fixed unless explicitly revised and promoted through the System Atlas.
