# System Authority

ONE is an authored system.

This System Atlas represents the system as designed, governed, and maintained by its primary author.
All classifications, constraints, interpretations, and promoted artifacts described here are intentional and owned.

ONE does not assert autonomous authority.
Models, workflows, and tools operate strictly within boundaries defined by explicit design decisions.
No component is permitted to self-authorise behaviour, interpretation, or truth.

Epistemic authority for the system resides with the author.
Accountability for system behaviour, limitations, and failure modes rests explicitly at that boundary.

Where uncertainty exists, it is named.
Where behaviour is constrained, it is documented.
Where claims are made, they are supported by inspectable structure or evidence.

This authority model is fixed unless explicitly revised and promoted through the Atlas.
