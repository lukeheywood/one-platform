# ONE — System Atlas

The System Atlas is the canonical, public map of ONE.

It documents **what has stabilised**, how it is structured, and where authority and responsibility sit.
It is intentionally limited in scope: the Atlas describes reality as it exists today, not everything that may exist in the future.

This is the entry point for understanding ONE.

---

## How to use the Atlas

- Start with **System Authority** to understand ownership and accountability.
- Review **Orientation** to understand the fixed semantic constraints the system operates under.
- Use **Capabilities** to see what exists today versus what is explicitly out of scope.
- Refer to **Architecture** for how components relate at a high level.
- Follow **Governance** links for contracts, invariants, and promotion rules.
- Inspect **Case Studies** for concrete, evidence-backed examples under load.

The Atlas links outward to specialist repositories and artifacts.
It does not duplicate implementation details.

## Sections

### Authority
Defines where epistemic authority and accountability reside.

- [System Authority](authority/system-authority.md)

---

### Orientation
The fixed semantic and design orientation that governs all system work.

- [North Star Orientation](orientation/north-star.md)

---

### Capabilities
What ONE currently does, what is experimental, and what is explicitly out of scope.

- [Capabilities Index](capabilities/index.md)
- [Capability Registry](capabilities/registry.md)

---

### Architecture
High-level structure and relationships between system components.

- [Architecture Overview](architecture/index.md)

---

### Governance
Contracts, invariants, and rules that constrain system behaviour.
This section links to canonical governance artifacts maintained elsewhere.

- [Governance Index](governance/index.md)

---

### Diagnostics
How system coherence, drift, and failure modes are evaluated.

- [Diagnostics Index](diagnostics/index.md)

---

### Case Studies
Promoted, evidence-backed demonstrations of system behaviour under real constraints.

- [Case Studies Index](case-studies/index.md)
- [Explainability Under Load](case-studies/explainability-under-load.md)

---

## Scope boundary

The Atlas intentionally excludes:
- runtime code
- private data
- internal logs
- speculative designs
- unfinished experiments

Only stabilised, inspectable material is promoted here.
