# GitHub Repo Index (Glass Case)

**Last verified:** 2026-01-01  
**Account:** `lukeheywood`  
**Purpose:** A black-and-white index of the public repos that make up the ONE “glass case”.

This is an index and a scope map. It does not describe private/local runtime systems.

## Canonical Hub

- **one-platform** — System Atlas (canonical truth surface)  
  - Role: promoted artifacts, contracts, case studies, and the public map of ONE  
  - Status: **Active / Canonical**  
  - Repo: https://github.com/lukeheywood/one-platform
