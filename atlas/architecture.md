# Architecture

At a high level, ONE is composed of several locally running engines, each with a clearly defined role.
This repository does not host those engines; it describes their relationships and constraints.

Key architectural themes:
- Local-first execution
- Explicit ingestion and promotion paths
- Separation of runtime systems from public representation
- Governance as a first-class concern

Public repositories linked from this Atlas represent **selected slices** of the broader system.
