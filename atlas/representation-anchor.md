# Representation Anchor (Frozen)

This document defines how work in ONE is explained to others and how value is represented.

Its purpose is to prevent over-explanation, defensive framing, and identity drift.

## REPRESENTATION_ANCHOR_V1

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Scope:** Interviews · Communication · Public Narrative  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-02

### Canonical Anchor

I move coherence out of people and into systems so AI can be used without breaking trust, identity, or responsibility.

### Representation Rules

When describing work:
- Lead with coherence and system self-knowledge.
- Describe *why* the system exists before *how* it is implemented.
- Offer implementation detail only when it serves clarity.

### Prohibited Framing

Do not lead with:
- feature lists
- component inventories
- tooling walkthroughs
- architectural diagrams without context

These are evidence, not identity.

### Purpose

This anchor exists to:
- reduce explanatory pressure
- avoid performative technical depth
- maintain alignment with the North Star
- ensure communication reflects actual system value

Deviation from this anchor is a signal to return to first principles.
