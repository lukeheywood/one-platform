# System Overview

ONE is a personal AI operating environment designed to remain coherent under real human and operational load.

The system prioritises:
- Clear boundaries between exploration, execution, and representation
- Deterministic contracts around data and workflows
- Explainability over optimisation
- Human-in-the-loop control

This Atlas documents **what has stabilised**, not everything that exists.

## Core Orientation (Frozen)

ONE is governed by a fixed semantic orientation: systems must be able to know and
explain themselves deterministically before AI is applied.

This orientation constrains system design, AI usage, and representation.
