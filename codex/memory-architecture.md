# Memory Architecture

ONE treats memory as an engineered subsystem, not an emergent side-effect.

Principles:
- Explicit ingestion paths
- Clear ownership of data
- Stable embedding semantics
- Retrieval governed by intent and context

Memory exists to support reasoning and recall, not to replace judgment.
