# Codex

The Codex contains **design philosophy, reasoning, and architectural intent** behind ONE.

These documents explain *why* the system was shaped the way it was — not *what is currently true* or *what is enforced*.

## What the Codex is

The Codex exists to:

- document design principles and trade-offs
- capture architectural reasoning and constraints
- explain human–system interaction philosophy
- provide context for decisions reflected elsewhere

It is a **thinking surface**, not a truth surface.

## What the Codex is not

The Codex is **not**:

- a governance or enforcement layer
- a contract or validation surface
- a guarantee of current system behaviour
- a promoted or inspectable representation

Statements here describe **intent and philosophy**, not binding system facts.

## Relationship to the System Atlas

Evidence-backed claims, promoted capabilities, and stabilised representations live in the **System Atlas**.

Where Codex documents discuss goals such as explainability, memory design, or workflow structure, **proof and scope live in the Atlas**, not here.

If there is any conflict:
- Atlas artifacts take precedence over Codex explanations.

## Relationship to Contracts

Formal constraints, validation rules, promotion gates, and boundaries are defined in `/contracts`.

The Codex does not override or reinterpret those constraints.
