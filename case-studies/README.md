# Case Studies

Case studies document **completed or stabilised work** that has been **promoted** into the public Atlas.

They focus on:
- observed context and constraints
- design decisions (and why naïve approaches failed)
- outcomes and explicit trade-offs
- limits (what the system does *not* do)

They are written for senior engineers and technical hiring managers.
