# Reference

This directory contains **non-authoritative supporting material** for ONE.

Artifacts here exist to:
- aid inspection or orientation
- support promoted Atlas material
- hold diagrams or excerpts that do not define system truth

Nothing in this directory is a source of authority.

If a reference artifact conflicts with:
- the System Atlas, or
- the Contract Stack,

the Atlas and Contracts prevail.

Material may be promoted out of `reference/` only through explicit review and inclusion in the System Atlas.
