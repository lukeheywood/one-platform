# Naming Conventions

Names are chosen to reflect **function and scope**, not ambition.

Guidelines:
- Prefer descriptive over clever
- Avoid overloaded terminology
- Match repo and document names to their role
- Do not imply execution or completeness unless true

Consistency is more valuable than novelty.
