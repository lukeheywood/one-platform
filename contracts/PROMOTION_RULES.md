# Promotion Rules

An artifact may be promoted to this Atlas only if:

1. Its intent can be explained clearly
2. Its scope and limits are explicit
3. It does not depend on private context
4. It improves overall system coherence
5. It can be maintained over time

If any of these fail, the artifact remains local.
