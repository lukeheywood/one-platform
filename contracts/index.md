# Contract Stack

This directory contains the **canonical system contracts** governing ONE.

These artifacts define:
- naming and semantic stability
- promotion eligibility and constraints
- system scope boundaries and exclusions

They are **authoritative sources of truth**.
The System Atlas references these documents but does not duplicate or reinterpret them.

## Included contracts

  [`NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`](NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md)

- **Promotion Rules**  
  [`PROMOTION_RULES.md`](PROMOTION_RULES.md)  
  Defines criteria and evidence requirements for promotion into the Atlas.

- **System Boundaries**  
  [`SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`](SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md)

## Authority

These contracts are binding.

Where a contract conflicts with convenience, interpretation, or tooling behaviour, the contract prevails.

Changes to these documents require:
- explicit revision
- documented rationale
