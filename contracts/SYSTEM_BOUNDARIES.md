# System Boundaries

This repository is a **public reference surface** for ONE.

It is intentionally:

- non-executable
- non-agentic
- bounded
- stable once promoted

---

## What this repository is

- A System Atlas: a curated map of what has stabilised
- A governance surface: contracts and constraints that prevent drift
- A hiring / technical discussion surface: inspectable artifacts for third parties

---

## What this repository is not

- Source code for runtime engines
- A private/local system export
- A roadmap or vision document
- Proof of correctness or automated guarantees
- A claim of autonomous intelligence

---

## Public vs local boundary

**Local/private (excluded):**

- runtime state
- private datasets and operational logs
- prompts, hidden instructions, and internal traces
- machine-specific config, keys, tokens
- non-redacted work artifacts

**Public/promoted (included):**

- bounded architecture descriptions
- deterministic contracts and governance
- declared capabilities (with limits)
- inspection surfaces that don’t expose private data
- evidence-backed case studies

---

## Authority boundary

- The system is **authored**.
- Authority is not delegated to models, tools, or automation.
- The Atlas describes promoted understanding; it does not self-justify.

---

## Safety rule

If publishing something would require:
- private context to interpret correctly, or
- runtime access to validate,

then it does not belong here.

Promoted truth must survive inspection without authority, access, or trust.
