# ONE — System Atlas

This repository is the **public System Atlas** for ONE.

It contains **curated, promoted artifacts** that describe system architecture, governance, and outcomes.
It is intentionally **non-executable** and **read-only in spirit**.

> This repository is a map — not the system itself.

---

## What this repository is
- A stable navigation surface for promoted work
- A coherence check across public artifacts
- A reference for technical discussion and assessment

## What this repository is not
- Not a runtime environment
- Not a development workspace
- Not a full code mirror
- Not an experiment log

The live system runs locally. Only reviewed and intentionally promoted artifacts appear here.

---

## Repository Structure

- **/atlas** — high-level system orientation and architecture
- **/contracts** — boundaries, promotion rules, and naming discipline
- **/codex** — reusable design reasoning and philosophy
- **/case-studies** — narrative, evidence-backed outcomes
- **/reference** — diagrams and explanatory snippets

---

## Audience

This Atlas is written primarily for **senior engineers and technical hiring managers**.
Clarity and boundaries are prioritised over breadth or hype.

---

## Promotion Principle

If an artifact exists here, it has been:
- Built and validated locally
- Reviewed for coherence and scope
- Intentionally promoted

Everything else remains private by design.
