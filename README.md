# ONE — System Atlas (Public Glass Case)

This repository is the **public System Atlas** for ONE.

It contains **curated, promoted artifacts** that describe architecture, governance, and concrete outcomes.
It is intentionally **non-executable** and **read-only in spirit**.

> This repository is the map — not the private/local system.

**Audience:** senior engineers, architects, and technical hiring managers  
**Last verified:** 2026-01-01

## What this repository is

- A stable navigation surface for promoted work
- A coherence check across public artifacts
- A reference for technical discussion and assessment

## What this repository is not

- Source code for runtime engines
- Private/local configuration, data, prompts, or logs
- A roadmap or a claim of future capability

## How to navigate

- **Atlas**
  - `atlas/overview.md` — what ONE is (systems-level)
  - `atlas/architecture.md` — engines, boundaries, relationships
  - `atlas/governance.md` — promotion rules and invariants
  - `atlas/repo-index.md` — **index of the public repos** (glass case map)
  - `atlas/current-state.md` — **current-state snapshot** of public repo content

  - `atlas/north-star.md` — **canonical semantic orientation** (frozen)
  - `atlas/governance/ai-usage-invariants.md` — **AI usage constraints** (frozen)
  - `atlas/representation-anchor.md` — **communication & representation rules** (frozen)

- **Contracts** (deterministic constraints)
  - `contracts/PROMOTION_RULES.md`
  - `contracts/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`
  - `contracts/NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`

- **Codex** (design notes, scoped)
  - `codex/memory-architecture.md`
  - `codex/workflow-philosophy.md`
  - `codex/explainability.md`

- **Case Studies** (promoted evidence)
  - `case-studies/system-explainability-under-load.md` — **Case Study 1 (canonical anchor)**

- **Reference**
  - `reference/diagrams/` — diagrams (when promoted)
  - `reference/snippets/` — short excerpts and snippets (when promoted)

## Promotion principle (black-and-white)

If an artifact exists here, it has been:

- built and validated elsewhere (private/local)
- bounded for public representation (scope and exclusions)
- reviewed for coherence against contracts
- intentionally promoted

Everything else remains private by design.

This index exists for orientation only.  
Each repository remains independently scoped and truth-aligned.
